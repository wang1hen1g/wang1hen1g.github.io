<h1 style="font-size: 40px;">Hi!</h1>

About me
=====
I'm a PhD researcher based at [GULP](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/critical/aboutus/resources/gulp/), University of Glasgow. I'm supervised by [Dr. Faith Chiu](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/critical/staff/faithchiu/) and [Dr. Rachel Smith](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/critical/staff/rachelsmith/).

My research
======
My research focuses on two key directions:
1. The design and construction of an in-situ characterisation tool (dilatometry) to understand the mechanical and chemical processes happening while cycling battery materials.
2. The development of scalable (R2R-compatible) processes to fabricate high areal-loading thick electrodes for Li-ion batteries.
