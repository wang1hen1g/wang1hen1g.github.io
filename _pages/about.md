<h1 style="font-size: 40px;">Hi!</h1>

About me
=====
I'm a PhD researcher based at [NanoManufacturing](https://www.nanomanufacturing.eng.cam.ac.uk/), Cambridge University. I'm supervised by [Professor Michael De Volder](https://www.ifm.eng.cam.ac.uk/people/mfld2/).

My research
======
My research focuses on two key directions:
1. The design and construction of an in-situ characterisation tool (dilatometry) to understand the mechanical and chemical processes happening while cycling battery materials.
2. The development of scalable (R2R-compatible) processes to fabricate high areal-loading thick electrodes for Li-ion batteries.
