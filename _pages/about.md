About me
=====
I'm a PhD researcher based at [GULP](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/critical/aboutus/resources/gulp/), University of Glasgow. I'm supervised by [Dr. Faith Chiu](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/critical/staff/faithchiu/) and [Dr. Rachel Smith](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/critical/staff/rachelsmith/).

My research
======
My research interests lie mainly within speech prosody, sociophonetics, and Glaswegian English. I am particularly intrigued by the intonation patterns of Glaswegian speakers, focusing on how speakers from different language backgrounds realise focus sentences.
